YOU SHOULD ONLY HAVE PYTHON RUNNING BECAUSE IF U RUN A LOT OF APPLICATIONS IT WILL GLITCH

Install pycharm and python (if you can do python3.8) Download the GetCode zip file and extract it. Move the folder to desktop or somewhere else
Once downloaded go run the program. Open the file by clicking file in the top left, click open, then find the folder you extracted
when u open the project, you should see an 'add configuration' on the top right, click it and it should ask you to create a new one. Click it and scroll down until you see 'python'.
after that you should see a menu of the project details. set the script path to wherever main.py is. It's in the LegoCodes folder. At this stage I suggest you copy the path to main.py It is important that the path ends in main.py or else you will get the same "can't find main" error. Next select an interperter, when u first start it will say . click the drop menu and select 'python3.8' or 'python3.9'. Any is fine.
If you are unable to find one then go to settings -> Project: ... -> project interpreter and click the settings icon and click 'Add'. Here you should see 4 tabs, go to VirturalEnv Interpreter and take note of 'Base Interpreter' path. Then click the System INterpreter tab and click the 3 dots and you should find your way until you find python.exe. That is the interpreter python will use to run the program.

Go to the import on the 2nd line (the text will be grey and can blend in with the other text) and click the ... hover your mouse over the "import selenium" and click alt+shift+enter to install it. If it doesn't work go to the file -> settings -> Project: ... -> project interpreter and click the + button and type selenium

There is another variable called folder, inside the '' will be the path to the folder, it's the same as the path to main.py except this time you get rid of the \main.py and yes get rid of the \. Alternatively if you are Windows and not planning on moving the project location, replace YOURNAME with your name or whatever is after Users 
Adjust the HowMany variable to how many codes u want to get and redeem to your account (your account will include the new codes plus the codes you added to LegoCodes.txt)
